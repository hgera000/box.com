API calls for box.com
=======
#Update September 2019
This code for uploading a file to box still works. Couple of tricks required when setting up an app on box.com:
1. Box.com will ask you what type of App you want to create when you create a new app in the Developer console. Choose 'Enterprise Integration'. 
2. On the next screen, chose the 'Standard OAuth 2.0 (User Authentication)' option as the authentication method. 


#Token Setup
0. An app associated with your box.com account first needs to be created through the box developers site: (https://app.box.com/developers/services). Set the redirect URL to be https://127.0.0.1
1. After cloning this repository, create the subfolder box.com/token. This folder will hold your client ID and client Secret, along with access token when generated. Do not make this folder public in any way (for example, never push this folder to github!)
2. Within the subfolder, create a simple text file and call it client.txt containing two lines (client_id and client_secret need to be copied from the application page):
```
cid = "paste in your client id here"
cpw = "paste in your client secret here'
```
3. Now it's time to generate a token. Paste the client_id into the link below, and access the website.
 
[Click this link to generate launch box login and generate first authorization code](https://app.box.com/api/oauth2/authorize?response_type=code&client_id=PASTE_CLIENT_ID_HERE&state=security_token%random_string_987654321 "Box.com login")
 
4. After logging in and authorizing your app, copy the token from the address bar, and paste it as a single argument as shown below.
```
python get_access_token.py "pastecodefromlinkabovehere"
```
5. That's it. It is now easy to refresh your applications credentials without any more mucking around. Just run:
```
python refresh_access_token.py
```
